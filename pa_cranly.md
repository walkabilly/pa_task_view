## Identifying Relevant Packages for the BiosignalData Task View

First step is use the `cranly` package to see what is out there. I found this tutorial to help https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/05/31/exploring-r-packages/. Now I have a tidy dataframe with all the packages. 




```r
library(cranly)
package_db <- clean_CRAN_db(tools::CRAN_package_db())
```

## Acquire and Clean CRAN Package Data

I have used the search terms:


      "physical activity",
        "actigraph",
        "Actigraph",
        "fitbit",
        "garmin",
        "geneactiv",
        "apple health",
        "google fit",
        "samsung health",
        "exercise",
        "omron",
        "actilife",
        "cycling",
        "swimming",
        "activity counts",
        "sedentary",
        "activPAL",
        "accelerometer", 
        "human activity recognition",
        "global positionning sytems",
        "wahoo",
        "whoop",
        "suunto",
        "human activity",
	  "ECG",
        "EKG",
        "EEG", 
        "physionet", 
        "Electrocardiography", 
        "electrocardiogram",
        "Electromyography", 
        "electromyogram",
        "EMG",
        "Electroencephalography",
        "biosignal", 
        "Electrooculogram",
        "Electroretinogram", 
        "Electrogastrogram", 
        "Galvanic skin response",
        "electrodermal activity"


```r
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
pa_search <- c("physical activity",
        "actigraph",
        "Actigraph",
        "fitbit",
        "garmin",
        "geneactiv",
        "apple health",
        "google fit",
        "samsung health",
        "exercise",
        "omron",
        "actilife",
        "cycling",
        "swimming",
        "activity counts",
        "sedentary",
        "activPAL",
        "accelerometer", 
        "human activity recognition",
        "global positionning sytems",
        "wahoo",
        "whoop",
        "suunto",
        "human activity",
	  "ECG",
        "EKG",
        "EEG", 
        "physionet", 
        "Electrocardiography", 
        "electrocardiogram",
        "Electromyography", 
        "electromyogram",
        "EMG",
        "Electroencephalography",
        "biosignal", 
        "Electrooculogram",
        "Electroretinogram", 
        "Electrogastrogram", 
        "Galvanic skin response",
        "electrodermal activity")
package_db$pa <- str_extract_all(package_db$description, paste(pa_search, collapse="|"))
pa_packages <- filter(package_db, pa != "character(0)")
```

From this search there are 10 packages are designed to analyse some type of biosignal data.


```r
table(pa_packages$package)
```

```

##   PhysicalActivity 
##                  1
```

```r
pa_pkg_names <- pa_packages$package
```

Just for fun make a network of the packages.


```r
package_network <- build_network(package_db)
pa_packages_network <- package_with(package_network, name = c(pa_pkg_names))
plot(package_network, package = pa_packages_network, legend = TRUE)
```
