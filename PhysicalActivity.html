            Generates ActiLife activity counts from raw acceleration data for different accelerometer brands. There is considerable research validating and developing algorithms for human activity using ActiLife activity counts. Unfortunately, ActiLife, the software which generates activity counts, is proprietary. This package generates activity counts from raw accelerometer data.The package contains two sample datasets.
<tt>sampleXYZ</tt>
            is a sample of raw accelerometer data in g units recorded by ActiGraph GT3X. Activity counts are generate for the
<tt>sampleXYZ</tt>
            and store in
<tt>sampleCounts</tt>
            dataset. To compare the package's result with ActiLife output the activity counts obtained from ActiLife software are also provided in

            It provides a function &quot;wearingMarking&quot; for classification of monitor wear and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess physical activity. The package also contains functions for making plot for accelerometer data and obtaining the summary of various information including daily monitor wear time and the mean monitor wear time during valid days. The revised package version 0.2-1 improved the functions in the previous version regarding speed and robustness. In addition, several functions were added: &quot;markDelivery&quot; can classify days for ActiGraph delivery by mail; &quot;markPAI&quot; can categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined cut-points of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph AGD files with &quot;readActigraph&quot; and &quot;queryActigraph&quot; functions. The package also better supports time zones and daylight saving.

            There are two goals for 'SwimmeR' as presently constructed. First, it converts swimming times (performances) between the computationally useful format of seconds, reported to the 100ths place (eg 95.37) and the conventional reporting format (1:35.37) used in the swimming community. Secondly 'SwimmeR' converts times between the various pool sizes used in competitive swimming, namely 50m length (LCM), 25m length (SCM) and 25y length (SCY).
