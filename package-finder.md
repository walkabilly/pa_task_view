## Creating a task view for physical activity researchers

First step is use the `cranly` package to see what is out there. I found this tutorial to help https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/05/31/exploring-r-packages/. Now I have a tidy dataframe with all the packages. 





```r
library(cranly)
package_db <- clean_CRAN_db(tools::CRAN_package_db())
```

## Search dataframe for physical activity related packages

I have used the search terms:

- physical activity
- actigraph
- fitbit
- garmin
- geneactiv
- apple health
- google fit
- samsung health

I had originally included the term `exercise` but that search included many packages that were not related to physical activity. I also did the same search in title but that did not help and only returned 1 result that was already captured in the description search. 



```r
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':

```r
pa_search <-
    c(
        "physical activity",
        "actigraph",
        "Actigraph",
        "fitbit",

        "activity counts",
        "sedentary",
        "activPAL",
        "accelerometer"
    )

package_db$pa <- str_extract_all(package_db$description, paste(pa_search, collapse = "|"))

pa_packages <- filter(package_db, pa != "character(0)")
```

From this search there are 10 packages are designed to analyse some type of physical activity data.






```r

Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'BigCamelCase' style was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well. </td>

'LSMRealOptions' provides implementations of the LSM simulation method to value American option products and capital investment projects through real options analysis. 'LSMRealOptions' values capital investment projects with cash flows dependent upon underlying state variables that are stochastically evolving, providing analysis into the timing and critical values at which investment is optimal. 'LSMRealOptions' provides flexibility in the stochastic processes followed by underlying assets, the number of state variables, basis functions and underlying asset characteristics to allow a broad range of assets to be valued through the LSM simulation method. Real options projects are further able to be valued whilst considering construction periods, time-varying initial capital expenditures and path-dependent operational flexibility including the ability to temporarily shutdown or permanently abandon projects after initial investment has occurred. The LSM simulation method was first presented in the prolific work of Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) &lt;doi:10.1093/rfs/14.1.113&gt;. </td>

In first step, the method tests for an overall marginal genetic association between the genetic variant and the multivariate phenotype. The genetic variants which show an evidence of marginal overall genetic effect in the first step are prioritized while testing for an overall gene-environment interaction effect in the second step.

   <td style="text-align:left;max-width: 100; "> Commodity pricing models are (systems of) stochastic differential equations that are utilized for the valuation and hedging of commodity contingent claims (i.e. derivative products on the commodity) and other commodity related investments. Commodity pricing models that capture market dynamics are of great importance to commodity market participants in order to exercise sound investment and risk-management strategies. Parameters of commodity pricing models are estimated through maximum likelihood estimation, using available term structure futures data of a commodity. 'NFCP' (n-factor commodity pricing) provides a framework for the modeling, parameter estimation, probabilistic forecasting, option valuation and simulation of commodity prices through state space and Monte Carlo methods, risk-neutral valuation and Kalman filtering. 'NFCP' allows the commodity pricing model to consist of n correlated factors, with both random walk and mean-reverting elements. The n-factor commodity pricing model framework was first presented in the work of Cortazar and Naranjo (2006) &lt;doi:10.1002/fut.20198&gt;. Examples presented in 'NFCP' replicate the two-factor crude oil commodity pricing model presented in the prolific work of Schwartz and Smith (2000) &lt;doi:10.1287/mnsc.46.7.893.12034&gt; with the approximate term structure futures data applied within this study provided in the 'NFCP' package. </td>

The flex versions will also compute the L-value for a user-defined number of minutes. IS describes the strength of coupling of a rhythm to supposedly stable zeitgebers. It varies between 0 (Gaussian Noise) and 1 for perfect IS. IV describes the fragmentation of a rhythm, i.e. the frequency and extent of transitions between rest and activity. It is near 0 for a perfect sine wave, about 2 for Gaussian noise and may be even higher when a definite ultradian period of about 2 hrs is present. RA is the relative amplitude of a rhythm.
